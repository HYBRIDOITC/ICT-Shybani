# ICT-Shybani
ABOUT US  While legal, economic, technological discourses are driving human intellectual discourses through a transformational phase and hence trickling down the effects to general masses globally, Muslim societies are a no exception. Being a dominant civilization, Western Enlightenment provides a cradle to most of such discourses leaving an impact on the individual as well as the collective or societal realms. Unlike many other societies with civilization backgrounds other than Islam, sections of the Muslim societies have attempted to offer a great deal of resistance to such tidings and at the same time struggling to offer an alternative discourse package which is rooted into their own paradigm of Tawhid.  As a next level, it wants to offer solutions to the issues from the perspective of their own knowledge and heritage which once spur from such a paradigm.  Shaybani Foundation would be adding itself into the line of an intellectual corpse by educating the individuals from a multitude of areas to understand the As-Is status of the Muslims in the present day scenario and how to cope with the challenges which are being faced by Muslims and humanity at large. In addition to academic trainings, SY would be perusing for a genuine intellectual activity in various domains and produce adequate literature in the form of books, journals, research articles and so on.  This whole effort is expected to contribute to the overall intellectual activity which would ultimately bring a confidence among Muslims about their heritage, explore the solutions to the issue being faced today and pitch recommendation when and where deemed necessary.
